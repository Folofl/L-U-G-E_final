L-U-G-E is a mobile game created in Unity for a Comp 23 project. 

Game description:
Collect letters to guess a word, knowing only the general theme and the number of letters in it. Avoid obstacles and pick up letters you want to guess by running your sled into them. After a word is completed, another is given and the game continues. Collecting an incorrect letter or crashing into an obstacle makes the player lose lives. Running out of lives ends the game. 

Controls
Tilt your phone to control the player.
